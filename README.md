AHK Essentials
==============

Essentials is a bundle of functions that are not natively implemented in
[AutoHotkey](http://autohotkey.com/) (or [AutoHotkey_L](http://l.autohotkey.com/))
but are - at least in my oppinion - essential.

This bundle (I wouldn't go so far as to call this a library) will be extended
whenever I feel some function is missing in AutoHotkey.

If you also have any functions that you think might belong here, feel free to
fork, edit and make a pull request. :)



Installation
------------

Clone the repository (or just download the `Essentials.ahk`) into a subdirectory
of your project (e.g. `libs`) and `#Include` it in your script.
